# CLAUDE.md Design

## Goal
Reference-card style CLAUDE.md at repo root for personal use with Claude Code. Covers repo navigation and role-writing conventions equally, includes known gotchas.

## Audience
Just me + Claude Code working in this repo.

## Approach
Flat, scannable sections with short rules and examples. No prose. Cheat-sheet style.

## Sections
1. Repo Overview — what it is, how to run, su/vault basics
2. Layout — directory tree with annotations
3. Tags — role groupings and how to combine
4. Writing Roles — multi-distro dispatch, packages, configs, variables, permissions
5. Gotchas — known landmines from build session
